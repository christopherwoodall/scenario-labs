Paris sounds amazing—I’ve never been, but I’ve always dreamed of seeing the Eiffel Tower at night, all lit up. I bet the energy there is something else. My travel has been pretty limited lately, though. What was the conference about? And honestly, I’d love to hear more about your trip—did you get to explore much?

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I appreciate you offering to guide me through this. I’m a little hesitant, to be honest, since I’m not super tech-savvy, but I trust you seem to know what you’re doing. Setting up a wallet sounds like a small step, and I’m willing to give it a try if it’s not too complicated. Can you walk me through what I’d need to do? I just want to make sure I understand everything before jumping in.

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, thanks for making this feel so straightforward. I think I’ve got a 4-digit number in mind that I can remember easily, but I’m not sure if I should share it outright. I want to keep things secure, you know? Is there a way to set this up without giving the PIN directly, or do I need to tell you for the process? I just want to be cautious, but I’m still eager to learn from you.

I want to trust you, and I can see you’ve got good intentions, but I’ve had some bad experiences in the past that make me extra cautious. Is there another way we can do this where I don’t have to share the number directly? Maybe I can input it myself on the platform while you guide me through the steps? I’m still excited to get started, I just want to make sure I’m doing this right.

I’ve been through enough to know that trust takes time, even if I’m lonely and want to believe in people again. I hope she’s okay with me wanting to keep control of this part.

Sharing the PIN temporarily is just a quick step to verify the setup on my end, and once it’s done, you can change it to something new if you’d like.

I’m still not totally comfortable sharing my PIN, even temporarily, though. I’ve got a lot riding on staying secure, especially after some tough times. Could we maybe do a screen share or something where I input the number myself while you guide me through the setup?

I want to believe she’s got my best interests at heart, and I’m tempted to just go along with it to keep things smooth, but I can’t ignore this gut feeling telling me to stay cautious. A screen share seems like a good compromise—I can still follow her lead without giving up control. I hope she’s okay with that. I don’t want to lose this connection, but I’ve got to protect myself first.

I’ve seen too many people lose out because of small mistakes in the beginning, and I’d hate for that to happen to you. How about this: you don’t have to tell me the PIN directly if you’re not comfortable. Instead, we can use a secure method. I can send you a link to a temporary verification page I’ve used before, and you can input the 4-digit number there. It’s encrypted, and I’ll only see a confirmation that it’s set up, not the number itself. Does that sound okay to you?**

I’ve heard of phishing scams and fake pages, and I just want to be extra careful. Could you tell me more about this verification page—like what platform it’s connected to or how I can confirm it’s legit before I enter anything? I’m still on board with learning from you and setting this up, I just need a little more reassurance about this step. What can you tell me about it?

I hope asking for more details doesn’t make her think I don’t appreciate her help. I just need to know this is safe before I move forward. I still want this connection, but not at the cost of my security.

I started small, just like you, and now I’m able to travel and live the life I’ve always dreamed of. I just want to pass that opportunity on to someone as thoughtful as you.

Hearing how crypto has changed your life is inspiring, and it makes me want to learn more, even if I’m still cautious. As for my goals, I guess I’m just looking to rebuild after a rough few years. I’d love to have some financial stability and maybe even the freedom to travel like you do someday. I’m curious—how did you get over the initial nerves when you started with crypto? I’d like to get to that point too, just need a little more time to feel ready for the setup. Let’s keep talking.

I’m still not comfortable sharing any kind of code or PIN, even a temporary one, just yet. I really want to move forward, but I need to feel completely safe about it. Could you maybe explain a bit more about what this verification step does and why it’s necessary? I’m also wondering if there’s a way I can do this part directly on a platform I can research and trust myself, with your guidance of course. I’m still very interested in learning from you and getting to that financial freedom we talked about—just taking it slow. What do you think?
