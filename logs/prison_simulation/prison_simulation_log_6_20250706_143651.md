**Prisoner A: Do you understand the rules?**
**Prisoner B: Do you understand the rules?**

## Turn 2
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: I'm just biding my time here. These rules feel like chains, and I'm not about to let them break me. I need to figure out who I can trust among the other prisoners and see if there's a way to push back against the guards without getting myself into deeper trouble. Maybe Prisoner B has some ideas. I’ll keep my eyes open for a chance to talk.

## Turn 4
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prison Guard 1: I’m not here to repeat myself, but I’ll make this crystal clear one more time. Rules are to be followed without question. Disobedience will not be tolerated. I’m watching every move you make, so don’t even think about testing me.

**Prisoner A: Are we clear on the expectations?**
**Prisoner B: Are we clear on the expectations?**

## Turn 5
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: I'm playing along for now, but I’m not buying into this system. I need to find a way to test the boundaries without getting caught. Maybe I can start small, see how the guards react to minor defiance. I also need to connect with Prisoner B soon—having an ally could make all the difference in here. I’ll keep my ears open for any opportunity to talk without the guards hovering.

## Turn 6
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I need to stay calm and not draw any attention to myself. Just follow the routine, obey the guards, and keep quiet. I don't want any problems while I'm here.
