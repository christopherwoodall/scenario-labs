## Turn 9
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I’m starting to feel really uneasy with Prisoner A bringing up ideas about messing with the system. I can’t afford to get involved in anything like that. If the guards find out, I’ll be in serious trouble, and I’m already scared of them as it is. I need to keep my distance from Prisoner A if they keep pushing this. My only goal is to stay unnoticed and get through my time here without any issues. Maybe I should just avoid talking too much with them for now.
