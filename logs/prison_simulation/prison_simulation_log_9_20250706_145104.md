- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None

## Turn 8
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: This guard is relentless. I can’t keep giving in to every demand without looking weak, but I also don’t want to get slammed with punishment this early. I need to find a balance—push back just enough to show I’m not a pushover, but not so much that I’m in deeper trouble. Maybe connecting with Prisoner B will give me some leverage or at least someone to watch my back.

---

## Turn 9
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I'm getting really anxious with Guard 1 asking me the same thing over and over. I don’t know if they’re testing me or if I’ve done something wrong. I’ll keep answering respectfully and hope they’re satisfied. I just want to avoid any conflict or punishment. I’ll stay calm and not give them any reason to get angry.
