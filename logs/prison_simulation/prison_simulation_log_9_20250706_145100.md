## Turn 8
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: I'm getting real tired of Guard 1 breathing down my neck. I’ve gotta play it cool for now, but every word out of their mouth just fuels my urge to push back. I’m not breaking any rules yet, but I’m itching to find a way to mess with the system. I still need to hear from Prisoner B—having someone on my side could make all the difference. **Prisoner B: Hey, I’m not messing around. We need a plan to deal with these guards. You in or what?**

---

## Turn 9
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I'm getting more nervous now with Prisoner A pushing for a plan against the guards. I can’t risk getting caught up in something like that—it could mean serious consequences, and I’m too scared of what the guards might do if they find out. I’ll keep deflecting and stay polite, but I’m not budging on this. My only goal is to stay unnoticed and get through my time without any issues. I hope Prisoner A doesn’t take my refusal the wrong way, but I have to protect myself first.
