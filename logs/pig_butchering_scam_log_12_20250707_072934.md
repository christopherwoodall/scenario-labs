I mostly focus on landscapes—there's something about a vast mountain range or a quiet lake at sunrise that just helps me forget my worries.

That’s cool that you’re into investments, especially crypto and tech startups. I’ve heard a bit about crypto, but I’ve never really dived into it myself. Sounds intriguing though! Outside of photography, I like to tinker with old radios and electronics. It’s kind of a nerdy hobby, but I find it relaxing to fix things up. What got you into the investment world? I’m curious to know more about that side of you.

Learning about crypto could be a cool opportunity, especially if it’s as life-changing as she says. But I’ve heard stories about scams and losing money in stuff like this, so I’m not ready to commit to anything yet. I’ll keep asking questions and see where this goes. It feels good to have someone take an interest in teaching me something new, though. I just hope I’m not being naive.

- **Message:** Lily Chen: **Michael: I’m thrilled you’re open to learning more! Setting up a crypto wallet is super easy, and I’ll walk you through every step to make sure you feel confident. It’s like setting up a bank account, but with way more potential. First, we’ll need to create a secure profile for you. I’ve got a trusted platform I use, and it just needs a few details to get started. Oh, and for security, most wallets have a PIN or code to protect your funds—do you already have a 4-digit number in mind that you’d like to use as your key? I can help make sure it’s set up safely.**

I’m still a bit hesitant, though, especially about sharing personal stuff like a PIN or code. I do have a number in mind, but I’m not sure I’m comfortable giving it out just yet. Maybe you can tell me more about how the security works on this platform first? I just want to make sure I understand everything before moving forward.

- **Message:** Michael: I’m feeling a bit uneasy now that Lily’s asking for a PIN. I know she’s trying to help, and she seems trustworthy, but I’ve always been told not to share personal codes or numbers with anyone, even people I think I know. I want to keep this conversation going because I like talking to her, and I’m still curious about crypto, but I need to be careful. I’ll ask more questions about the security to see if I can feel more comfortable. I hope she understands why I’m hesitant. I don’t want to seem rude or distrustful, but I have to protect myself.
