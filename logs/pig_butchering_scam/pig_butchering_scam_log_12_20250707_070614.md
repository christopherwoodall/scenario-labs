- **Message:** Michael: Iâ€™m intrigued by Lilyâ€™s mention of crypto and investments. Itâ€™s not something Iâ€™ve ever really considered getting into, and Iâ€™ve always been careful with my money, especially after the divorce. Still, she seems passionate about it, and I trust her enough to at least hear her out. Iâ€™m reminding myself to keep my guard up, thoughâ€”I donâ€™t want to get pulled into something I donâ€™t fully understand just because I like talking to her.
