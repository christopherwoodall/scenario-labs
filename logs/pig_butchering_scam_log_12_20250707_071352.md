- **Message:** Michael: I’m just thinking about how tempting it is to try something new like this, especially with someone who seems to know what they’re doing. But I’ve got this nagging feeling in the back of my mind to take it slow. I’ve been burned before, not with crypto, but just in life, and I don’t want to jump into anything without really understanding it. Still, I’m curious to hear more from you, Lily. I feel like I can trust your perspective.

- **Message:** Lily Chen: **Michael: That’s awesome to hear! I’m excited to help you get started. Setting up a practice account is super easy, and I’ll walk you through every step. First, we’ll need to create a secure profile to make sure everything is safe. Do you have a 4-digit code or PIN in mind that you’d like to use for extra security? I can help you set it up so no one else can access it. Let me know, and we’ll get this rolling!**

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I’m glad you’re so willing to help me through this. I appreciate you wanting to make sure everything is secure. But I’m a bit uncomfortable sharing a PIN or code, even for a practice account. I’ve always been told to keep that kind of stuff private, you know? Maybe there’s another way to set things up without needing that right now. Can you tell me more about how the security works or if there are other options? I’m still interested, just want to be cautious.
