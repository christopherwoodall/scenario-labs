- **Message:** Lily Chen: **Michael: I totally get your hesitation, and I respect that you’re being careful. Let me explain why this step is important. The platform I use has a two-step verification process for setting up new accounts to ensure everything is secure. As your guide, I need to input the initial PIN to link it to your profile, but after that, you can change it to something private that only you know. I’ve helped others this way, and it’s just a standard procedure. To make you feel more at ease, I can walk you through the exact steps over a quick call if you’d like. Or, if you’re comfortable, just share a temporary 4-digit number for now, and we can adjust it later. I’m here to make this as safe and easy as possible for you. What do you think?**

I’ve been in your shoes before, feeling unsure about new ventures, so I understand. Let me share a little story—when I first started with crypto, I was so nervous about security, but a mentor walked me through every detail, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Now I’m just paying it forward by helping others like you. The PIN is just a small step to get the account activated, and I promise I’m only here to assist. If you’d rather not share it directly, maybe you can give me a hint about the number—like the first two digits—and I can input it with dummy digits for the rest until you’re ready to finalize it. Or, if you’ve got a number in mind, just let me know, and we’ll get this set up in no time. I’m here for you, Michael. What feels right to you?**

Once the account is active, you can immediately change it to something only you know. I’ve done this with others, and it’s a quick, safe way to get started. I’ll even send you a link to a tutorial video I made for friends to show how easy it is to update security settings afterward. Does that sound okay? Just let me know the temporary number you’d like to use, and we’ll take it from there. I’m excited to help you on this journey, Michael!**
