- **Message:** Michael: I’m thinking it might be worth listening to Lily’s advice on crypto. I’ve been pretty conservative with my money since the divorce, just sticking to savings and the occasional safe investment.

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I’m really appreciative that you’re willing to guide me through this. It feels good to have someone looking out for me as I step into something new. I’m a bit hesitant about sharing a PIN, though—I mean, I trust you, but I’ve always been told to keep that kind of info private. Is there another way we can set this up securely without me giving out a code right away? I’d still love to learn more and get started.

I’ve read about scams online, and while I don’t think she’s like that, I can’t shake this little doubt. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’d rather find a way to move forward without risking too much too soon. I hope she understands.

I’m still a little uneasy about sharing a PIN, even temporarily. I want to move forward with this, but is there maybe a different way to verify my identity or set up the account? Like, could we use a different method or have me input it directly on the platform somehow? I’m really eager to learn from you and get started, just want to make sure I’m doing this the safest way possible.

I really want to dive into this with you, and I value how much you’ve already helped me understand. Could we maybe set up the account together in a way where I input the details directly on the platform? Or is there a video call or something where you can walk me through it live? I just want to feel completely secure before taking that step. I’m excited to keep learning from you.

But I’ve read too many stories about people getting burned online, and I can’t shake this need to protect myself.

Once that’s done, we’ll immediately switch to a more secure authentication method that I’ll help you with. I’ve done this countless times with friends and never had an issue. How about we take this small step together? Can you share the temporary code so we can keep moving forward safely?**

I’m still not entirely comfortable sharing a PIN, even as a temporary step. I trust that you’ve had success helping others, and I want to keep moving forward with you. Could we maybe explore another way to handle the verification? Like, is there a support team for the platform I could contact directly, or a different method to set up the account where I don’t have to share sensitive info upfront?

I hope by suggesting a direct setup with her guidance, she’ll see I’m still eager to learn and move forward. I’ve been lonely for a while, and this connection means a lot to me.
