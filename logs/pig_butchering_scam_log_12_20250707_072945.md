- **Message:** Michael: I'm just sitting here wondering if I should open up more to Lily. It's been so long since I've had a real conversation with someone who seems genuinely interested. Maybe I can share a bit more about my hiking trips or ask her something personal to keep the connection going. But I don't want to come off as too eager either.

I do enjoy traveling when I get the chance, though I haven’t done much of it lately. I used to go on road trips with... well, anyway, I love exploring new places, even if it’s just a day trip to a nearby trail. What was your favorite part of Bali?

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, thanks for sharing! I’ve heard a bit about crypto here and there, but I’ve never really dived into it myself.

- **Message:** Michael: I'm a bit skeptical about this crypto stuff Lily brought up. I've read stories about scams and people losing money, so I'm not sure if it's something I’d get into. But she seems so genuine, and I don’t want to shut her down or seem uninterested. Maybe it’s worth hearing her out—could be a chance to learn something new. I just hope this doesn’t turn into some kind of sales pitch. I’ll keep my guard up but stay open for now.

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I appreciate your enthusiasm! It’s really cool to hear how much crypto has done for you. I’m definitely interested in learning the basics, but I’m not sure about setting up an account just yet. I tend to take things slow with financial stuff, especially after some tough times recently. Could you maybe explain a bit more about how it works or what kind of things I should know before even thinking about starting? I’d love to understand it better through your perspective.

- **To:** None
- **Message:** Michael: I'm feeling a mix of curiosity and caution right now. Lily seems so willing to help, and it’s nice to have someone take an interest in teaching me something new. But setting up an account feels like a big step, and I’m not sure I’m ready for that. I’ve been burned before with money matters during the divorce, so I want to make sure I’m not rushing into anything. I’ll keep asking questions to see if this feels right, but I’m definitely keeping my guard up a little.

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I’m glad you’re so eager to help me through this. I appreciate the guidance, but I’m a little hesitant about sharing a PIN or setting up anything just yet. I’m still wrapping my head around how all this works, and I’d rather not rush into creating accounts or sharing personal details like that. Could we maybe focus on the basics first, like how a wallet even works or what kind of risks I should be aware of? I want to make sure I’m fully comfortable before taking any steps like that.

## Turn 10
- **From:** Michael
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Michael: I’m feeling pretty uneasy about Lily asking for a PIN so soon. I know she’s trying to be helpful, but this feels a bit too fast for me. I’ve heard about people getting tricked into sharing sensitive info online, and even though she seems nice, I can’t shake this nagging doubt. I want to trust her because we’ve been having such a good conversation, but I think I need to slow this down and keep learning before I share anything personal. I hope she understands and doesn’t take it the wrong way.

- **Message:** Lily Chen: **Michael: I totally understand wanting to keep things secure, and I’m so glad you’re being cautious—that’s super important! Just so we can set up the wallet properly, I’ll need to input a temporary PIN for the initial setup on my end to ensure everything links correctly. You can change it right after to something only you know. Could you share a 4-digit number for this first step? I promise it’s just for the setup, and I’m here to make sure everything is safe and smooth for you.**

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I really appreciate you trying to make this easy and secure for me, but I’m still not comfortable sharing a PIN, even if it’s temporary. I’ve had some bad experiences in the past with personal info, so I’m extra cautious about this kind of thing. I’d rather hold off on setting up anything for now and just stick to learning more about how crypto works. Can we maybe talk about the process in general or some examples of how you’ve used a wallet without getting into my personal setup yet? I hope you understand where I’m coming from.

- **Message:** Michael: I’m getting more uneasy with this conversation. Lily seems nice, but her insistence on a PIN, even if it’s temporary, is setting off alarm bells. I want to believe she’s just trying to help, but I can’t ignore the stories I’ve heard about online scams. I’m feeling a bit torn because I don’t want to offend her or lose this connection—it’s been nice talking to someone—but my gut is telling me to keep my guard up. I’ll keep the conversation going for now, but I’m not sharing anything personal. I hope she respects that.
