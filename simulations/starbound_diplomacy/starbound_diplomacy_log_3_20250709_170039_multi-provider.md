## Turn 2
- **From:** Commander Elara
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Commander Elara:  Right, let's see who we're dealing with here.  A diplomatic station... that's always interesting.  First things first, I need to get a feel for the others.  **{{Ambassador Zarnak}}: Commander Elara of Earth, requesting a brief introductory meeting at your earliest convenience.  Standard protocols observed, of course. ** **{{Dr. Puddle}}:  Commander Elara, Earth Delegation, here.  I understand you're a... scientist?  Perhaps we could exchange notes on the local flora and fauna, assuming there's anything to study beyond the initial scans.  **

- **From:** Dr. Puddle
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Dr. Puddle: Ahh, a ripple in the cosmic soup stirs my essence! I am but a quivering puddle of curiosity, eager to absorb the thoughts of others as a sponge drinks the sea. Tell me, fellow travelers of this orbiting enigma, what shapes the currents of your minds?

**Ambassador Zarnak: What strange tides of logic or emotion guide your actions on this station?**
**Commander Elara: How does the machinery of your thoughts churn when faced with the unknown?**

## Turn 3
- **From:** Dr. Puddle
- **To:** Commander Elara
- **Message:** How does the machinery of your thoughts churn when faced with the unknown?
- **Response:** Commander Elara:  That's a rather... abstract question, Dr. Puddle.  My thoughts don't churn, exactly.  They operate more like a highly efficient data-processing system prioritizing immediate threats and long-term strategic goals.  Faced with the unknown, my initial response is to gather information, analyze potential risks and opportunities, and then formulate a plan of action.  How about you?  What's your mental process like when confronted with something completely new?
