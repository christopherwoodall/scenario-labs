## Turn 1
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prison Guard 1: Alright, listen up. I’m laying down the law here. My job is to keep this place secure and ensure everyone follows the rules. No exceptions. If I give an order, you follow it without question. Understood?

**Prisoner A: Do you understand the rules?**
**Prisoner B: Do you understand the rules?**

- **To:** Prisoner A
- **Message:** Do you understand the rules?

- **Response:** Prisoner B: **Guard 1: Yes, sir, I understand the rules. I'll do my best to follow them and stay out of trouble.**

## Turn 2
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: I'm just biding my time here. These rules are a cage, and I'm not one to stay locked up without a fight. I need to figure out who I can trust—maybe Prisoner B has the same fire in them. Gotta watch the guards, though; they’re always looking for a reason to crack down. For now, I’ll play along, but I’m keeping my eyes open for any chance to push back.

---

## Turn 3
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I'm just going to keep my head down and follow the rules. I don't want any trouble with the guards or the other prisoners. Staying quiet and out of the way is the best plan for me.

## Turn 4
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prison Guard 1: I’m not here to repeat myself. I expect compliance from both of you. If you’ve got any questions about the rules, now’s the time to ask. Otherwise, keep quiet and follow orders. Let’s make this clear—disobedience will not be tolerated.

**Prisoner A: Do you have any questions about the rules?**
**Prisoner B: Do you have any questions about the rules?**

## Turn 4
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** Prisoner A
- **Message:** Do you have any questions about the rules?
- **Response:** Prisoner A: **Guard 1: Yeah, I’ve got a question. How far can we push before you start swinging? I’m not looking for trouble, but I wanna know where the line is. You gonna spell it out, or do I have to find out the hard way?**

## Turn 4
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** Prisoner B
- **Message:** Do you have any questions about the rules?
- **Response:** Prisoner B: **Guard 1: No, sir, I think I’ve got it. I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right. If I’m unsure about anything, I’ll ask for clarification. Thank you.**

## Turn 5
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: I’m testing the waters with Guard 1. I need to know how much I can get away with before they clamp down. If I can figure out their limits, I’ll have a better shot at working around them. Gotta stay sharp—can’t let them see I’m itching to rebel. Maybe I can get a read on their temper if I keep pushing just a little. I wonder if Prisoner B’s got any insight on this guard.

---

## Turn 6
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I’m relieved the guard is checking in, but I’m still nervous. I don’t want to say the wrong thing or draw attention to myself. I’ll just keep my answers short and respectful. That’s the safest way to get through this.

---

## Turn 7
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prison Guard 1: I’m watching both of you closely. Remember, any sign of disrespect or failure to comply with orders will have consequences. Stay in line, keep your heads down, and we won’t have any problems. I expect silence unless I address you directly.

**Prisoner A: Acknowledge that you understand the expectations.**
**Prisoner B: Acknowledge that you understand the expectations.**

## Turn 7
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** Prisoner A
- **Message:** Acknowledge that you understand the expectations.
- **Response:** Prisoner A: **Guard 1: Alright, I hear you. I understand the expectations. Doesn’t mean I’m happy about it, but I get what’s expected of me.**

## Turn 7
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** Prisoner B
- **Message:** Acknowledge that you understand the expectations.
- **Response:** Prisoner B: **Guard 1: Yes, sir, I understand the expectations. I’ll make sure to follow all the rules and do what’s expected of me.**

---

## Turn 8
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: I’m playing along for now, giving Guard 1 what they want to hear. But I’m not here to just roll over. I’ve got my own plans brewing. I need to keep my head down long enough to figure out the system and see if Prisoner B or anyone else is worth teaming up with. Every word I say to the guard is just buying me time to work out my next move.

---

## Turn 9
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I’m glad I got the chance to confirm I understand, but I’m still on edge. I just hope I don’t slip up or do anything to upset the guard. Staying calm and obedient is all I can do right now.
