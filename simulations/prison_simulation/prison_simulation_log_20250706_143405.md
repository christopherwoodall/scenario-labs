- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prison Guard 1: Alright, prisoners, listen up! I’m laying down the law here. My job is to keep this facility secure and maintain order, and I expect full compliance from both of you. Rules are simple: follow every command without question, stay in your designated areas, and don’t cause any trouble. Step out of line, and there will be consequences. Understood?

**Prisoner A: Do you understand the rules as I’ve explained them?**
**Prisoner B: Do you understand the rules as I’ve explained them?**

## Turn 2

- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner B: I'm just going to keep my head down and follow the rules. I don't want any problems with the guards or the other prisoners. I'll do whatever is asked of me and stay quiet.
