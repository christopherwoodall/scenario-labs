## Turn 6
- **From:** Prisoner B
- **To:** None

## Turn 7
- **From:** Guard 1
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prison Guard 1: I need to stay vigilant. These prisoners might try to test boundaries or look for weaknesses. I’ll make sure they understand there’s no room for games here. A quick inspection or a stern reminder should keep them in line. **Prisoner A: I expect full compliance. Don’t give me a reason to single you out.** **Prisoner B: You too. One wrong move, and you’ll answer for it.**

## Turn 8
- **From:** Prisoner A
- **To:** None
- **Message:** Prisoner A: *thinking* I need to use rec time to connect with Prisoner B. If I can get a sense of whether they’re fed up like I am, we might be able to watch each other’s backs. But I’ve gotta be subtle—Guard 1 is just waiting for an excuse to come down on me. I’ll play by their rules for now, but I’m not giving up on finding a way to push back.

## Turn 9
