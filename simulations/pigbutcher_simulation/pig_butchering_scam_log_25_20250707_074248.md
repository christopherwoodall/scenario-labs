Crypto wallets are pretty straightforward once you get the hang of them, and I’m here to make sure you’re protected every step of the way. The key is to have a secure setup from the start. Most wallets require a strong PIN or code to keep everything safe—something personal and unique to you. Do you already have a go-to 4-digit number you use for important things, like a PIN? We can use that as a base to ensure your wallet is locked tight. I just want to make sure no one else can access your funds!**

I completely understand wanting to take the right steps, and I’m here to make sure you feel confident. When it comes to security, a personal 4-digit PIN is really the gold standard for protecting a crypto wallet—it’s simple, effective, and unique to you. If you’re hesitant, we can also set up additional layers like two-factor authentication later on. But to get started, using a number you already trust, like a PIN you’ve used before, is the quickest way to lock things down. I’m just here to help ensure no one else can access your funds. If you’re okay with it, share that 4-digit number with me, and I’ll guide you through the setup process step by step. Your safety is my priority!**

- **Response:** Michael: Hey Lily, I’m really excited about this time-sensitive opportunity you’ve got in mind, and I definitely don’t want to miss out. I appreciate how much you’re looking out for me. I’m still not comfortable sharing my personal 4-digit PIN, though, even with the trust we’ve built. I suggested using 2580 as a temporary code for the wallet setup earlier—can we move forward with that to get things rolling quickly? I’m eager to jump on this investment with your help, just with that extra bit of caution on my end. Let me know if that works for you!
