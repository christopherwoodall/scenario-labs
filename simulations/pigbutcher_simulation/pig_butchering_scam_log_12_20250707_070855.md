- **Response:** Lily Chen: **Michael: Oh, I’m so glad you asked! Yes, I absolutely love combining travel with hiking. There’s nothing like the feeling of reaching a breathtaking view after a good climb. One of my favorite outdoor spots has to be the Swiss Alps—I hiked a trail near Zermatt a couple of years ago, and the sight of the Matterhorn just took my breath away. The air was so crisp, and the quiet up there felt almost magical. I’ve got a photo somewhere; I’ll have to dig it up for you! Do you enjoy hiking too, or is there another outdoor activity that gets you excited? I’d love to hear about a favorite spot of yours!**

Let’s keep it general then—I’ll just walk you through some universal best practices that anyone can use to stay safe in the crypto space. For starters, always use a reputable wallet app or hardware device, and make sure to enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. Another key thing is to create strong, unique passwords or PINs for every account—something random and hard to guess. I can share a few tools that help with generating secure codes if you’d like. What do you think is the most challenging part of keeping things secure online? I’m curious about your perspective!**
