Setting up a practice account together could be a good way to learn without too much risk. I’m definitely curious, though I’ll admit I’m still a bit nervous about the whole thing. Can you tell me more about how a practice account works and what the first steps would be? I’d like to understand it better before diving in. Thanks for being so patient with me!

- **Message:** Michael: I’m feeling a bit of a rush talking to Lily about this. It’s nice to have someone willing to guide me through something new, especially since I’ve been feeling so out of touch lately. I’m still a little wary about crypto—it’s unfamiliar territory, and I’ve heard stories of people losing money. But a practice account sounds safe enough to at least learn the ropes. I don’t want to seem too skeptical and push her away, though. I’m really enjoying this connection, and I want to keep the conversation going.

This PIN is just a small step to ensure your practice account is protected during setup—it’s not tied to anything personal or financial yet, just a placeholder for the system.
